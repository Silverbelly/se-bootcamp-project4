### Software Engineering Bootcamp - Project 4

Created by Jon Noel (Silverbelly), February 2025

##### Overview

This is the fourth and final project that is part of the UTA Software Engineering Bootcamp,
February 2025 cohort, of which I am a part. The final project is a full-stack development
project. Through the development process, I operated as though I had been given the requirements
by my employer and it was my responsibility to deliver a web application that fulfilled those
requirements.

The requirements are included in the 'requirements' folder.

  - wireframes were specified in the requirements document

There are two parts to this full stack development project, the server and the client. 
Server functionality is found in the 'server' folder. 
Client functionality is found in the 'client' folder.

##### Basic functionality

The purpose of this project is to provide a web application for posting questions and 
receive responses to those questions.  A database backend is utilized to store the information.

##### Technologies Used

- Node.js and Express (server side functionality)
- React (client side functionality)
  - Base application created using create-react-app
  - single page application (SPA) functionality
  - includes state management, input references, navigation
- React-Bootstrap is used for implementing React components that have a consistent look and feel across the application
- CSS for custom styling and overriding/extending React-Bootstrap
